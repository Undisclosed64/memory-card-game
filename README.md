## DESCRIPTION:
This project is a memory card game built using ReactJS. The purpose behind this project was to implement important react concepts like functional components and hooks to build something fun and engaging. 

## Key points

#### <li>It has a deck of cards and each card has a matching pair.</li>

#### <li> The player flips two cards at a time in an attempt to find the matching pair.</li>

#### <li>If both cards are not same, they flip back automatically.If they are same, they are considered as played cards and any further click on them is disabled.</li>

#### <li>When the player finds all the matching cards, the game ends showing a congratulatory message containing the number of tries the player needed to finish the game.</li>

#### <li>The cards get shuffled on load and also on the click of refresh button so that the next time user plays,he doesn't has the advantage of knowing the position of matching cards.</li>

#### <li>Last but not the least, I had a lot of fun building it. Hope the one who plays finds it fun too!</li>
